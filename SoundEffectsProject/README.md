# Sound Project Submission
###By Cameron Dye and Zach Howell
## Final Results
In the folder finalSongs are the songs we played Thursday during class. There are two versions of each track, one made using sounds from real instruments, and one made from the most musical sound effects we could find.
## Running the Code
Run 
python midiAssembler.py
There are no command line arguments. At the moment it's set up to run the 'twelveBZ' MIDI file and turn that into 'outP' wav using the files in the channel as inputs. 
## Presentation
Our presentation is in here as a pdf (PlayingMIDIWithSoundEffects)
## Selection of Sound Effects
We chose instruments based off the recommended MIDI instrument (basically a corresponding real sample of the instrument). 
For sound effects, we tried a large number of effects. Many sounds became too distorted when shifted to different pitches. Sounds generally sounded best when they could ocassionally be heard as their original sound. For example, the baby sound effect in twelveSounds.wav is only recognizable sometimes. 
Sound effect length was also important. Initially, we tried lots of very short sound effects. We found those didn't actually hold up well with the long musical notes of Dvorak in particular. 
## Source of Sound Effects
The sound effects came from all over.. Many came from freesounds.org; those sounds are preceded by the uploading user, ex esperri__dog_bark was uploaded by the user esperrri. Some instruments were taken from the Philharmonia Orchestra (http://www.philharmonia.co.uk/explore/make_music). Those sounds are prefixed by their instrument name and have the form flute_C5_025_forte_normal.
